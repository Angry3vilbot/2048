# 2048
## Overview
This is my rendition of the classic browser game 2048, made using [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) with [SvelteKit](https://svelte.dev/docs/kit/introduction) and [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/). The game is fully playable and features full mobile support and persistent save data. Support for swipe gestures is done through [Hammer.JS](https://squadette.github.io/hammer.js/). The high score, current score and game board (if applicable) are saved in cookies for **2 weeks**, allowing you to come back to the game after leaving.
